# 01 — Build plan

origin: idea-0003 @ state/0013

> Style guardrails for every phase below. Always ship unit tests
> alongside code — never "add tests later". Small focused files in
> folders. Run `/seed-check` before any step a phase brief did not name.

## Status (at-a-glance)

`/march`, `/ship-a-phase`, and (transitively) `/loop` read this block to
find the next phase. Status vocabulary: `[ ]` pending → `[x]` shipped
(with commit hash); `[skipped]` (set only via `/oversight`);
`[blocked: <reason> <date>]` (set by `ship-a-phase` on a phase-shaped
failure — `/march` skips it, `/oversight` unblocks it); `[-]`
partial-with-carry-overs. Tick in this file in the same commit that ships
the phase.

**The garden (phase 1):**
- [ ] Phase 1 — The garden (stack, env manifest, verify gate, deploy
      target, seed skills; done = one tick on nothing)

**The engine (phases 2–4):**
- [ ] Phase 2 — Tables as data, and creation
- [ ] Phase 3 — Engine core
- [ ] Phase 4 — Effects and Oracle lines

**The cave and its home (phases 5–9):**
- [ ] Phase 5 — The adventure format and The 5 Treasures
- [ ] Phase 6 — The campaign record and the save
- [ ] Phase 7 — The trail-head village
- [ ] Phase 8 — The UI
- [ ] Phase 9 — The web release

**The milestone (phase 10, by 2026-12-05):**
- [ ] Phase 10 — The cave played to its ending `[needs-user-call]`

**The sandbox (phases 11–14, by 2027-03-05):**
- [ ] Phase 11 — Word-table lines
- [ ] Phase 12 — Sandbox procedures
- [ ] Phase 13 — Native builds `[needs-user-call]` for accounts
- [ ] Phase 14 — The whole sitting `[needs-user-call]`

> **After phase 14:** the loop transitions to `/iterate` — gaps, audits,
> link rot. `/march` makes that transition automatic.

## Per-phase scope

Each row above corresponds to one phase. The detailed brief lives at
`plan/phases/phase_<N>_<topic>.md`. Only the garden's brief ships with
the payload; if a later brief is missing when the loop reaches its phase,
`/plan-a-phase` generates one from the scope below and `spec.md`.

### Phase 1 — The garden

Makes the loop able to run. Nothing here is a feature. Detailed brief:
`phase_1_bootstrap.md`. Done when `/ship-a-phase` on a trivial slice goes
green end to end: verified, deployed, reported.

### Phase 2 — Tables as data, and creation

**Done when:** the schema validates every file; the eight presets load
with Yin flagged; a Master rolls from fixture dice with the pools
reported.
**Waits on:** Phase 1
**Cost:** one to two weeks

One JSON Schema; every table of the rulebook and the adventure as data
with `cite` and `label: rule` (Martial Arts, Techniques, Rituals, Final
Blow, Unexpected Events, Deities, XP, hooks, region, route, road,
monastery, city services and encounters, Market lists, Oracle rows,
Inspirations, Sparks, encounter matrix, Treasures, Special Items, 50
opponents, eight presets as printed). The dice interface with a
fixed-sequence test source. Creation: rolled attributes, one Martial
Art, gold by status, Training deduction, pools from rolled SKILL checked
and flagged, never refused; attributes not typeable.

### Phase 3 — Engine core

**Done when:** every rule in the estate's inventory has a fixed-dice
test; the label leg is green; a scripted fight resolves end to end.
**Waits on:** Phase 2
**Cost:** three to four weeks

Checks with LUCK −1 after every LUCK check and a double six failing every
check; doubles rolls are non-checks and a double six lands. Attack
Strength with one relevant Proficiency; the winner's four options;
Opening; Final Blow on doubles with the LUCK exception (−1 on failure
only); a tie is an Unexpected Event ending the combat phase; retreat rows
roll Morale (1–3 flee, 4–5 cautious retreat, 6 rally +1d6). Multiple
combat: SKILL reduced by headcount, one Master roll against each attacker
up to ATTACK, ATTACK inert against a lone Master. Escape (−2, Dishonor),
healing (+4 by technique, regeneration, meal, elixir or a night's rest;
full by a week), XP by SKILL band with caps, spirits immune to ordinary
blows, the Oracle, encounters by column, Treasure roll, Special Items.
Every behaviour exports `{label, cite}`; the reading ids as a list.

### Phase 4 — Effects and Oracle lines

**Done when:** 149 authored lines in the content package; every effect
record has a test; the count is readable from the build.
**Waits on:** Phase 3
**Cost:** two to three weeks

The 72 Technique and Ritual effect records under five classes
(mechanical, combat-narrative, exploration, oracle-like, summoning),
each with cost, timing, engine operation and an authored line; the 66
Oracle cells and 11 Unexpected Events with a line each. The agent drafts
all; the operator may reserve any (`[needs-user-call]` for those only).

### Phase 5 — The adventure format and The 5 Treasures

**Done when:** the format's document and the cave's file are in the
content package; a scripted Master reaches the ending screen on fixed
dice.
**Waits on:** Phase 3
**Cost:** two weeks

A versioned, documented format (areas with gated hints, event and
encounter tables, foes, loot, treasures, locks and keys, per-adventure
flags, act markers, an ending screen). The cave: eight areas, nine foes,
five treasures, one key held by the Ghost and the Beast, the Junior King
as one entity across tables, the gourd toggling day and night, Ogres
absent by night, the Monk as a rescue with Dishonor on attack, fled Kings
gone from their tables, an original SVG room diagram.

### Phase 6 — The campaign record and the save

**Done when:** a record survives export, import and one migration in
tests; the override count increments on a non-dice manual entry.
**Waits on:** Phases 3 and 5
**Cost:** one to two weeks

One record per campaign: Master with the overspend mark, deeds ledger,
per-adventure flags, passages, reading ids, override count. Continue or
fresh start at each scene; the world dies with the Master. Versioned JSON
export and import with migrations keyed on reading ids.

### Phase 7 — The trail-head village

**Done when:** the village loads from data; buy, LUCK recovery and a
night's rest run in tests; every behaviour labelled.
**Waits on:** Phase 3
**Cost:** one week

The rulebook's City procedures (Market, Temple with one Spirituality
success per day, an inn with meals and rest) generalised and applied to
a fixed village with three locations and the trail to Flat-top mountain.

### Phase 8 — The UI

**Done when:** a Playwright run creates a Master and wins a fight on the
web export; the layout decision is recorded.
**Waits on:** Phases 4, 5, 6, 7
**Cost:** three weeks after the layout is picked

`[needs-user-call]` **Layout:** the agent renders three layouts at phone
width with a working beat and files them; the operator picks; the agent
builds it. Creation in the book's order with presets; the beat (authored
line, menu, free-text field always present); combat showing both rolls;
the rules panel with three labels; dice with manual entry; the cave's
areas; the village; the campaign record screen with export and import.

### Phase 9 — The web release

**Done when:** the Cloudflare URL serves the milestone build; the
release checklist is in the repository and ticked.
**Waits on:** Phases 1 and 8
**Cost:** days

Attribution screen (Gianluca Monaco, Cristian Cammarata, limofeus,
watabou; CC BY-SA 4.0); release checklist (verify, deploy-check, the
scripted cave run, the label leg, content counts printed); deploy; the
operator installs the web app to a phone.

### Phase 10 — The cave played to its ending, by 2026-12-05

**Done when:** on 2026-12-05 a campaign record exists whose cave reached
the ending screen with the PDF closed, or the falsifier is recorded as
fired with its reason.
**Waits on:** Phase 9
**Cost:** the operator's evenings; the date is fixed

`[needs-user-call]` The operator plays the cave to the ending screen; the
agent fixes what the operator reports through the loop. Evidence: the
record, its override count, the content counts. A field report goes back
to the estate as `capture` on idea-0003.

### Phase 11 — Word-table lines

**Done when:** 437 authored lines in total, or a smaller number with the
fallback named.
**Waits on:** Phase 10 in time only
**Cost:** three to four weeks of writing

The 72 Inspirations and 216 Sparks with an authored line each; the
operator may reserve any (`[needs-user-call]` for those only); the build
prints the shipped count.

### Phase 12 — Sandbox procedures

**Done when:** a seeded test throws a region, enters a location,
resolves an encounter and the record carries it; a Master leaves the
cave into a region on the web build.
**Waits on:** Phases 6, 10, 11
**Cost:** four to six weeks

The region generator (N points, nearest-neighbour links, miles as the
sum of two dice with the route band from the same sum, positions
decorative and declared so); region columns per the rule on visit and
per move with the at-throw variant as a labelled reading; monastery
generation; road features; the five encounter columns and the 36 hooks
as menus; City procedures on a generated City; scene transitions from
the cave's ending; continue or fresh start.

### Phase 13 — Native builds

**Done when:** a build on each internal track, or the phase blocked on
the named account with the web release as distribution.
**Waits on:** Phase 9; may run beside Phases 11 and 12
**Cost:** one week of agent work; the operator's accounts on their own
clock

`[needs-user-call]` Expo account, Apple developer membership, Google Play
console, a Mac for iOS; the agent writes the EAS configuration and names
every credential up to the line; deploy-check extended to poll EAS; a
smoke run on each track by the operator (`[needs-user-call]`).

### Phase 14 — The whole sitting, by 2027-03-05

**Done when:** on 2027-03-05 the operator has thrown a region, entered a
location, resolved an encounter, and the record carries it, exported and
imported once, on a phone; or the falsifier is recorded as fired.
**Waits on:** Phase 12
**Cost:** one evening; the date is fixed

`[needs-user-call]` The operator performs the whole sitting. Evidence:
the campaign record, the content counts, the village present. A field
report goes back to the estate; the third falsifier's clock starts.

## Carry-overs / known gaps (update as phases ship)

(Empty until phases ship. Add `[-]` rows for partial-but-shipped phases
with linked notes here.)

## Phase log (commit hashes)

(Empty until phase 1 ships. One line per shipped phase:
`phase <N> — <commit hash> — <one-line summary>`.)
